## Description

In this MERN-stack single-page dating application, a user can create and maintain a profile that allows them to post life updates, browse other users and their posts, and much more. This application allows birds to connect with other birds to find their true love. This is made possible through a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform.

## Usage
